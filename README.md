Trying to make a component that takes text and renders
it, but allows selections from the user to be highlighed.
I found: https://medium.com/unprogrammer/a-simple-text-highlighting-component-with-react-e9f7a3c1791a

Which is what I got this started based on. However, I want
the use to be able to highlight multiple sections of text.
